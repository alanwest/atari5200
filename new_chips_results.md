# Results after installing new chips

I purchased the following chips from [Best Electronics](https://www.best-electronics-ca.com/):

* 1  Atari CO14806 CPU chip
* 8  Atari 5200 Ram chips CO18082
* 1  Atari 5200 OS chip CO19156
* 1  Atari 5200 Antic chip CO12296
* 1  Atari 5200 GTIA chip CO14805

After installing all the new chips the Atari 5200 still does not work.

One interesting thing is that the new Antic chip C012296 gets very hot when the console is powered on. Almost too hot to touch.

I kept all the new chips installed in the console and tried swapping in the old Antic chip.

Here are some photos comparing the console's operation with the new and old Antic chip installed.

## Console off

When powered off, the TV displays static

## Console powered on with new Antic chip

When powering on the console the screen goes black, but no image is displayed.

## Console powered on with old Antic chip

With the old chip installed you can kind of make out the Q bert start screen, but the image remains very fuzzy.
